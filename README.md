#iot-voice-control-home-automation-system-using Arduino
Project Description
This project implements a voice-controlled home automation system using Arduino and a voice recognition module (e.g., EasyVR, DFPlayer Mini, or Arduino with an AI voice assistant like Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa via IFTTT). The system allows users to control home appliances (lights, fans, etc.) using voice commands.

Features
âœ… Voice Recognition â€“ Recognizes predefined voice commands to control devices.
âœ… Wireless Control â€“ Supports Bluetooth (HC-05/HC-06) or Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32) for remote control.
âœ… Multiple Device Control â€“ Controls relays connected to appliances (e.g., lights, fans, AC).
âœ… Customizable Commands â€“ Add or modify voice commands as needed.
âœ… LED Feedback â€“ Visual indicators for command recognition.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP8266/ESP32 (Main controller)

Voice Recognition Module (EasyVR, DFPlayer Mini, or AI-based voice assistant integration)

Relay Module (4-channel or 8-channel for appliances)

Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06) or Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32)

Breadboard & Jumper Wires

Power Supply (5V/12V)

LEDs & Resistors (Optional for feedback)

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (Download here)

Voice Recognition Library (e.g., EasyVR Library, SerialCommand)

Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Libraries (if using wireless modules)

Setup & Installation
Hardware Connections

Connect the voice module to Arduino via UART (RX/TX).

Connect relays to Arduino digital pins.

Connect Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module if using remote control.

Upload the Code

Open the Arduino sketch (voice_control_home_automation.ino) in Arduino IDE.

Install required libraries (e.g., EasyVR.h, SoftwareSerial.h).

Upload the code to your Arduino board.

Configure Voice Commands

Train the voice module with custom commands (e.g., "Light on," "Fan off").

Test recognition using the serial monitor.

Power Up & Test

Connect appliances to relays.

Speak commands and verify device control.

Example Commands
"Turn on the light" â†’ Activates Relay 1

"Turn off the fan" â†’ Deactivates Relay 2

"Switch on AC" â†’ Activates Relay 3

Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ AI Integration â€“ Use Google Assistant/Alexa for cloud-based voice control.
ðŸ”¹ Mobile App Control â€“ Develop an Android/iOS app for remote access.
ðŸ”¹ Energy Monitoring â€“ Add sensors to track power consumption.
